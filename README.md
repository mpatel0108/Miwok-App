Miwok App
===================================

In this app, we have a parent activity and 4 child activities. Parent activity displays the categories. On clicking on a category the relevant child activity opens up. Child activities are displayed in a listview. Each element in the list has an image, Miwok word, English translation of the Miwok word and audio for the Miwok word.

When the Number category is clicked in the home screen user is navigated to NumbersActivity. In the child activity, we used adaptors to implement view recycling. AudioFocus has been implemented in the app to avoid playing the app the audio in case of a phone call or other priority apps playing.


This was an overall fun project to work on. I got to learn about layouts, intents user testing, AudioManager that manages audio focus depending on the priority, etc. The project has strengthened my fundamentals in making me ready to build bigger and full-fledged apps.
